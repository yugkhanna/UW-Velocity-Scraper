# UW-Velocity-Scraper

A web scraper I wrote which scrapes the list of companies and the information about them from the UWaterloo Velocity website using BeautifulSoup and requests libraries and exports the data to a csv file.

This is a script I wrote to minimize the time required to collect data manually during work.
